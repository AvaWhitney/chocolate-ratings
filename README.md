# Chocolate Ratings Analysis

This project demonstrates the power of data science in analyzing sensory-driven topics. Through EDA, probability modeling, regression analysis, and geospatial visualization, we uncovered the key factors that contribute to a great chocolate bar.

This repository contains all the code, visualizations, and insights from the analysis.

## Project Overview

The goal was to uncover:

- **What flavors, textures, and ingredients make chocolates highly rated?**
- **Do certain brands consistently perform better?**
- **How does cocoa percentage influence chocolate ratings?**
- **Which countries produce the best cocoa beans?**

The analysis includes:

- **Web Scraping**: Extracting chocolate ratings using Selenium.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding rating distributions and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Investigating brand influence with regression analysis.
- **Probability Modeling**: Using log-odds ratio to analyze word associations.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualizing cocoa-producing countries and quality.
- **Chocolate-Themed Data Visualizations**: Custom-styled plots inspired by the richness of chocolate.
